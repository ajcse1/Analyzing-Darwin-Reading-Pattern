# Analyzing Darwin Reading Pattern

Introduction

This project has been built upon and is an extension to an earlier paper- “Exploration and Exploitation of Victorian Science in Darwin’s Reading Notebooks” by Jamie Murdock, Colin Allen, and Simon DeDeo. The paper implemented some novel techniques to extract very useful information and pattern from the data of Charles Darwin’s notebook where he kept his reading records.

The available data includes KL divergence between the books, probability distribution of topics (20, 40, 60, 80), list of all the topics, raw data, as well as some metadata about the books.

In order to delve deeper in this rich dataset, I applied data analysis techniques learned in High-dimensional Statistical Analysis course which include- 

Principal Component Analysis

Multidimensional Scaling

Isomap

K-means

Spectral Clustering

I also used different proximity measures like Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, JS Distance, KL-Divergence and Angle Dissimilarity. 

The results obtained give further insights into the mind of Charles Darwin through the books he read.
